### Olá, amigos! 👋

I am _notmgsk_. Why _not_? Not sure. Once upon a time I was `mgsk` on IRC (even cooler, I had the TLA `mgs` on `irc.freenode.net`). Oh 💡 maybe it was because `@mgsk` was taken on Twitter 👎 so the `not` prefix felt appropriate, and has since stuck. Technically I am also [`mgsk`](https://github.com/mgsk) on GH, where my alter ego dwells.
